## Under construction...
## Thank you very much for accessing this repository!
### I created this project using the following technologies:
- JavaScript;
- React;
- React Hooks;
- Redux;
As I have always enjoyed exploring programming I decided to create this personal project to explore my creativity and also my knowledge of these technologies...

### My biggest difficulty was in applying and understanding Redux,
### At the same time I never get tired of incrementing this project more and more...
